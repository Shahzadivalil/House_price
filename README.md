# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Its a regressive problem.Here XGB Regressor is used for predictions.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for various tasks, including regression problems like house price prediction. XGBoost Regressor is a specific implementation of XGBoost tailored for regression tasks. Here's a step-by-step description of how to use XGBoost Regressor for house price prediction:

# Data Preparation:

Gather a dataset with features (independent variables) and target values (house prices).
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Import Libraries:

Import the necessary libraries, including xgboost for XGBoost, and other data manipulation libraries like numpy and pandas.

# Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and perform feature engineering if needed.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary.

# Model Creation:

Import the XGBoost Regressor from the xgboost library.
Create an instance of the regressor, specifying hyperparameters such as the learning rate, maximum depth of trees, and the number of estimators (trees).
ou can adjust hyperparameters based on your dataset and requirements.

# Model Training:

Fit the XGBoost Regressor to the training data.

# Model Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

# Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

To improve model performance, you can perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.
Feature Importance:

XGBoost provides a way to assess feature importance, which can help you understand which features have the most impact on house prices.

# Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for making predictions on new, unseen data.
Remember that the success of your house price prediction model using XGBoost Regressor depends on the quality of your data, the appropriate selection of hyperparameters, and the effectiveness of your data preprocessing techniques.
